Data structures and operators:

'Lists' are mutable, ordered collections that can store a variety of items and allow modifications. They are defined using square brackets [ ], and you can easily add, remove, and access elements.

'Tuples' are immutable, ordered collections, meaning once they are created, their contents cannot be changed. They are defined using parentheses ( ) and are useful for fixed collections of items.

'Sets' are unordered collections of unique items. Defined using curly braces { }, sets are useful for operations like union, intersection, and difference, and they automatically handle duplicate values.

'Dictionaries' are mutable, unordered collections of key-value pairs. Defined using curly braces { } with key-value pairs separated by colons, dictionaries provide a way to store and retrieve data efficiently by unique keys.

Basic operators in Python include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, >, <), logical operators (and, or, not), and assignment operators (=, +=, -=). These operators are essential for performing calculations, comparing values, and controlling program flow.

Number System Conversions: Python supports conversions between different number systems, such as binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal. Functions like bin(), oct(), and hex() convert integers to binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats, respectively, while int() can convert these formats back to decimal.
